# This file must be checked into Version Control Systems, as it is integral to the build system

#
# You can use this to override default values such as "source.dir" for the location of your java
# source folder and "out.dir" for the location of your output folder.
#
# You can also use it define how the release builds are signed by declaring "key.store" for the
# location of your keystore and "key.alias" for the name of the key to use. The password will be
# asked during the build when you use the 'release' target.
